# CodOpY

CodOpY is a python package facilitating the design of codon optimised gene sequences. The CodOpY functionality is organised into two modules:

Commands in **CodopY.optimise** are useful for the design of optimal coding sequences for recombinant gene products.

Commands in **CodOpY.plot** are useful for visualising various sequence properties relating to codon usage and sequence optimisation.

## Installation

Run the following to install:
```python
pip install CodOpY
```
